      <p><em><strong>The Lunar Chronicles</strong></em> is a series of four young adult science fiction fantasy novels, a novella and a short story collection written by American author Marissa Meyer and published by Feiwel &amp; Friends. Each book entails a science fictional twist on a classic fairy tale, including Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Snow White. Set in a futuristic world inhabited by various species and creatures, tensions are rising between Earth and its former colony Luna, while both attempt to manage an ongoing pandemic. An animated feature film adaptation, to be produced by Locksmith Animation, was announced in 2019.</p>

      <h3>Origins</h3>
      <p>The idea for the series started with an entry Meyer wrote for an online Sailor Moon fan fiction writing contest in 2008. The contest had a list of 10 things, in which she had to choose two things to use in a short story. From the list, she chose to use a fairy tale character and to set the story in the future. She ended up writing a short story that was a futuristic retelling of Puss in Boots with Sailor Moon characters. It was the first time Meyer ever wrote science fiction, and it inspired her to give sci-fi twists to classic fairy tales.</p>
      <p>Meyer chose to adapt Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel and Snow White as she felt she had the best ideas for them. She chose different parts of the world to set the different books in, because she wanted the series to have "a really big global feel, in part because the issues the characters are facing are big global issues â€” there's this war happening between Earth and Luna that affects everybody on the planet, and there's this plague that has become an enormous widespread problem." She also wanted readers to know that this wasn't just happening in this one city or in this one country; this was something that affects everybody." She planned to write a series, though she first envisioned it with every book being a standalone story, and it wasn't until later when she was brainstorming and started outlining the books that she decided it was going to become one continuous story in which different fairy tale characters would merge together to take down the evil queen instead.</p>
      <p>Meyer developed the initial drafts of Cinder, Scarlet and Cress for the November 2008 National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). However, all three of those novels had to be mostly scrapped and rewritten during revisions.</p>

      <h3>Reception</h3>
      <p>The series is a retelling of fairytales where the female protagonists were originally passive participants. Due to the portrayal of strong female characters as an alternate to the conventional fairytale characters throughout its four books, this series is now considered an example of feminist literature.</p>

      <h3>Film adaptation</h3>
      <p>Marissa Meyer has reported that the movie/TV rights for The Lunar Chronicles have been optioned and a script is in the works by NBCUniversal. In February 2019, Meyer posted on her Instagram story that she was awaiting a phone call from her film agent, but no new news concerning a Lunar Chronicles movie or television series has arisen since then. However, in January 2022, Locksmith Animation has acquired the film rights.
